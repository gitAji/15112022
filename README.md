# Semester Project 2
### Goal
To take the skills learned over the past three semesters and create an auction website.<br>

### Brief
An auction site is looking to launch a website where users can add items to be bid on and bid on items other users have put up for auction.<br>

When a new user joins the website, they are given 1000 credits to use on the site. They can get credits by selling items and use credit by buying items. Non-registered users can search through the listings, but only registered users can make bids on listings.<br>

### User stories
The client has specified the following requirements in the form of User Stories:<br>

<li>A user with a stud.noroff.no email may register</li>
<li>A registered user may login</li>
<li>A registered user may logout</li>
<li>A registered user may update their avatar</li>
<li>A registered user may create a Listing with a title, deadline date, media and description</li>
<li>A registered user may add a Bid to another user’s Listing</li>
<li>A registered user may view the last highest Bid made on a Listing</li>
<li>A registered user may view their total credit</li>
<li>A registered user may get credit by getting a successful Bid on their Listing</li>
<li>A registered user may use credit to make a Bid on another user’s Listing</li>
<li>A user (registered or not) may search through Listings</li>
